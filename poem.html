    <h1> poem of hope</h1>
    <p>HOPE is the thing with feathers <br>
That perches the soul, <br>
And sings the tune without the words, <br>
And never stops at all,</p>
<p>And sweetest in the gale is heard; <br>
And sore must be the storm <br>
That could abash the little bird <br>
That kept so many warm.</p>
<p>Have heard it in the chillest land,<br>
    And on the strangest sea;<br>
    Yet, never, in extreamity,<br>
    It asked a crumb of me.</p>
